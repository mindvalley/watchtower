// Findings a watchtower has already judged acceptable.
//
// Without this, every scan re-reports the same false positives — a public
// reCAPTCHA site key read as a secret, a CVE in a package that is only ever
// loaded in development — with no way to say so. Re-reporting a judgement that
// has already been made erodes trust in the whole report.
//
// An allowance REMOVES the finding from the score and keeps it visible in the
// report, marked, with the reason it was allowed. Nothing disappears: a page can
// always say "3 findings, 1 allowed". That is deliberate — a mechanism that
// deleted findings would be indistinguishable from a scan that never ran, which
// is the failure this engine guards against everywhere else.
//
// WHERE THE LIST LIVES is the caller's business, exactly like the list of systems
// to scan (see engine-config.js). Two shapes, one file format:
//
//   local   the engine repo is also the runner, so the file sits beside the
//           config in that same repo
//   remote  a private watchtower repo holds the file; the engine is pulled in as
//           a pinned action and holds nobody's allowances
//
// FILE FORMAT
//
//   { "allowances": [
//       { "criterion": "security", "sub": "secrets",
//         "system": "billing-api",
//         "file": "config/dev.exs", "rule": "generic-api-key",
//         "reason": "Public reCAPTCHA site key, not a secret",
//         "allowed_by": "a.engineer@example.com", "allowed_on": "2026-01-31T09:32:00.000Z" }
//   ] }
//
// An entry matches a finding when EVERY field it names is equal. Leave a field
// out and it broadens: drop `file` and the rule is allowed anywhere. That is the
// intended way to write a general allowance, and it is also the danger, so the
// run reports how many findings each entry absorbed and which absorbed none.
//
// Deliberately NOT supported, each for a reason:
//
//   globs          an allowance is an audit record; listing the files you mean
//                  is tedious and honest, where a pattern quietly widens over
//                  time. Add on evidence, not in advance.
//   duplication    C8's percentage comes from jscpd's own totals, not from the
//                  list of duplicated blocks, so filtering that list would not
//                  move the score — and subtracting each pair's lines
//                  double-counts a block cloned three times. Out until it can be
//                  done correctly.
//   absences       "no rollback configured" is not a false positive. Allowing it
//                  would be accepting a risk, which is a different feature.

/*
 * Where a scan's working tree comes from.
 *
 * Every scan program used to do the same two lines: make a temp directory,
 * shallow-clone `cfg.repo` into `<tmp>/repo`. That is the only thing a target
 * could be, so running the scanner on a laptop scored whatever was on the
 * remote's default branch rather than the code in front of you — the check you
 * wanted to run before opening the pull request measured the branch you were
 * about to change.
 *
 * A system now declares `repo` OR `path`. Exactly one.
 *
 *   "billing": { "repo": "org/billing",   "stack": "elixir" }
 *   "billing": { "path": "code/billing",  "stack": "elixir" }
 *
 * A relative `path` is resolved against the DIRECTORY HOLDING THE CONFIG, not
 * the working directory. The config sits beside the projects it describes, and
 * resolving against the shell's cwd would make the same config mean different
 * things depending on where you happened to run it from. Nothing in this engine
 * is discovered by walking upwards, and this keeps it that way.
 *
 * A LOCAL TARGET IS COPIED, NOT SCANNED IN PLACE, and there are three separate
 * reasons — any one of them enough:
 *
 *   1. The scan writes into the tree it is reading. graphify drops a
 *      `graphify-out/` directory into the repo root. Scanning in place would
 *      leave build output inside somebody's working copy.
 *   2. Third-party scanners report absolute paths, and repo-paths.js turns them
 *      back into repo-relative ones by matching a `scan-<something>/repo/`
 *      prefix under the temp directory. That rule
 *      is shared with the allowances matcher, so a target outside that shape
 *      would make every allowance silently match nothing — which reads exactly
 *      like a feature nobody wired up. Materialising into the SAME shape means
 *      neither of those files has to learn about local targets at all.
 *   3. A working copy is not a clone. It holds `node_modules`, `_build`,
 *      coverage output and whatever else is gitignored, and gitleaks, jscpd and
 *      the LOC walk would all read them. The copy carries what git carries:
 *      tracked files plus untracked ones that are not ignored — which is to say
 *      the code you are about to push, uncommitted edits included. That is the
 *      thing you wanted measured.
 *
 * HISTORY IS READ FROM THE ORIGINAL. The copy has no `.git`, and C1's change
 * coupling needs a commit log. Rather than copy the object store, the scan is
 * handed a separate `historyDir` pointing at the source. It is only ever read
 * from — `git log`, nothing else. When the source is not a git repository at
 * all, `historyDir` is null and coupling reports itself unmeasured, which it
 * already knew how to do.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE EVER DELETES A DIRECTORY IT DID NOT CREATE. `cleanup()` removes
 * the temp directory and only the temp directory. The clone path relies on that
 * to shred a `.git/config` holding a plaintext token; the local path must never
 * be able to do the same thing to somebody's project.
