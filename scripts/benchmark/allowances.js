// Findings a watchtower has already judged acceptable.
//
// Without this, every scan re-reports the same false positives — a public
// reCAPTCHA site key read as a secret, a CVE in a package that is only ever
// loaded in development — with no way to say so. Re-reporting a judgement that
// has already been made erodes trust in the whole report.
//
// An allowance REMOVES the finding from the score and keeps it visible in the
// report, marked, with the reason it was allowed. Nothing disappears: a page can
// always say "3 findings, 1 allowed". That is deliberate — a mechanism that
// deleted findings would be indistinguishable from a scan that never ran, which
// is the failure this engine guards against everywhere else.
//
// WHERE THE LIST LIVES is the caller's business, exactly like the list of systems
// to scan (see engine-config.js). Two shapes, one file format:
//
//   local   the engine repo is also the runner, so the file sits beside the
//           config in that same repo
//   remote  a private watchtower repo holds the file; the engine is pulled in as
//           a pinned action and holds nobody's allowances
//
// FILE FORMAT
//
//   { "allowances": [
//       { "criterion": "security", "sub": "secrets",
//         "system": "billing-api",
//         "file": "config/dev.exs", "rule": "generic-api-key",
//         "reason": "Public reCAPTCHA site key, not a secret",
//         "allowed_by": "a.engineer", "allowed_on": "2026-01-31" }
//   ] }
//
// An entry matches a finding when EVERY field it names is equal. Leave a field
// out and it broadens: drop `file` and the rule is allowed anywhere. That is the
// intended way to write a general allowance, and it is also the danger, so the
// run reports how many findings each entry absorbed and which absorbed none.
//
// Deliberately NOT supported, each for a reason:
//
//   line numbers   they move on the next commit, so the allowance would either
//                  go stale silently or, worse, later match a different finding
//   globs          an allowance is an audit record; listing the files you mean
//                  is tedious and honest, where a pattern quietly widens over
//                  time. Add on evidence, not in advance.
//   duplication    C8's percentage comes from jscpd's own totals, not from the
//                  list of duplicated blocks, so filtering that list would not
//                  move the score — and subtracting each pair's lines
//                  double-counts a block cloned three times. Out until it can be
//                  done correctly.
//   absences       "no rollback configured" is not a false positive. Allowing it
//                  would be accepting a risk, which is a different feature.
